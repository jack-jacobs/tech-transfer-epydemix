# Session 4: Exercise Solutions

Solution notebooks for the Session 4 exercises. Try to solve the exercises yourself before looking at these!

## Solutions

| Exercise | Notebook | Key Concepts |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| 1. SEIRS Model | [exercise_1_seirs_model.ipynb](exercise_1_seirs_model.ipynb) | Waning immunity, R→S transition, comparing SEIR vs SEIRS |
| 2. Intervention Comparison | [exercise_2_interventions.ipynb](exercise_2_interventions.ipynb) | `add_intervention`, contact layer reductions, quantifying impact |
| 3. Two-Strain Model | [exercise_3_two_strains.ipynb](exercise_3_two_strains.ipynb) | Multi-strain dynamics, `override_parameter`, variant emergence |
| 4. SEIR Calibration | [exercise_4_seir_calibration.ipynb](exercise_4_seir_calibration.ipynb) | ABC-SMC, priors, projections, model comparison |

## Running the Solutions

Each notebook can be run:
- **Locally:** With Epydemix installed (`pip install epydemix` or `conda install -c conda-forge epydemix`)
- **Google Colab:** Click the Colab badge at the top of each notebook (installs dependencies automatically)
